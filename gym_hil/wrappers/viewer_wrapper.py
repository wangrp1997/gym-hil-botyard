        MuJoCo's `Renderer` gained a `close()` method only in recent versions
        (>= 2.3.0).  When running with an older MuJoCo build the renderer
        instance stored inside `env.unwrapped._viewer` does not provide this
        method which causes `AttributeError` when the environment is closed.

        To remain version-agnostic we:
          1. Manually dispose of the underlying viewer *only* if it exposes a
             `close` method.
          2. Remove the reference from the environment so that a subsequent
             call to `env.close()` will not fail.
          3. Close our own passive viewer handle.
          4. Finally forward the `close()` call to the wrapped environment so
             that any other resources are released.
